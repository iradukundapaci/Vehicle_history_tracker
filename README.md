Vehicle Tracking System
This project is a Vehicle Tracking System that consists of a Flask API for managing vehicle-related data, a web scraper for gathering vehicle information, and a DataHandler module for processing data.

Flask API
The Flask API provides endpoints for user authentication, managing user accounts, adding, updating, and deleting vehicles, and downloading reports based on vehicle data.

Web Scraper
The Web Scraper module is responsible for scraping vehicle information from online sources. It extracts data such as vehicle make, model, year, and specifications.

Usage
Import the WebScraper class from web_scraper.py.
Create an instance of the WebScraper class.
Use the scrape_vehicle_info method to scrape vehicle information.
python
Copy code
from web_scraper import WebScraper

scraper = WebScraper()
vehicle_info = scraper.scrape_vehicle_info(vehicle_url)
print(vehicle_info)
DataHandler
The DataHandler module processes data received from the Flask API and Web Scraper. It performs tasks such as generating reports, analyzing data, and handling file operations.

Usage
Import the DataHandler class from data_handler.py.
Create an instance of the DataHandler class.
Use the provided methods for data processing.
python
Copy code
from data_handler import DataHandler

data_handler = DataHandler()
report_file_path = data_handler.generate_report_file(vehicle_owner, vehicle_type, license_plate, date)
print(report_file_path)
